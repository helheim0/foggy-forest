# Welcome to Foggy Forest color theme

After debuting with my first light theme... I thought it's time to make something similarly pleasant but in dark mode. So Foggy Forest happened, with its calming atmopshere, mainly with shades of green and some blue.

I find it very relaxing to look at, hopefully you'll enjoy it too :)
